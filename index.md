## About Me

Hi, My name is Deannia Lucas. I am from Kingston Jamaica. I immigrated in 2009 with my two boys, Alexei and Waren. I decided to make this move for my boys so that they could have the opportunity to experience the American Dream. I have a Bachelors Degree in Early Childhood Education along with my Illinois Director Licenses. I had to switch to my current field because it was a struggle for me to get hired as a Program Director; all the Program Director jobs that I applied for I was racially profiled. The interviewers would always suggest that I should consider being a Teacher or Teacher's Assistant, although I am qualified with over 15 years’ experience working in a similar position. I hope that pursuing this Masters in Data Science that I will be given a chance to gain some experience and showcase my knowledge.
I’m interested in biking, road trips and traveling to different countries with my boys. 
I’m currently during a research on the Dream Project experimenting with ELAN, and working on completing my MSc in data science. I will be graduating Summer 2023.

## About My Project

I’m currently collaborating on The DREAM project; manipulating an avatar in the American Sign Language database using ELAN and Tableau. Main focus is using data gathered from ELAN to explain the connection between mouthing and just simple hand movements when commmunicating. Mouthing can be defined as the production of visual syllables with the mouth while signing. According to the article https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/mouthinginasl2.htm "The use of American Sign Language requires more than just simple hand movements to convey a message.  Without the use of proper facial expressions and other non-manual signals (NMS), a message could be greatly misunderstood.  Involved in these non-manual signals are one's eyes, eyebrows, cheeks and mouth.  These must be used to communicate clearly and effectively in daily conversations (Valli & Lucas, 21)." With the help of my team Maria Saenz and Nicole Barnekow we will gather data to look at specific mouth movements and the resemblance or correlation to spoken English.

## About Me

Hi, My name is Deannia Lucas. I am from Kingston Jamaica. I immigrated in 2009 with my two boys, Alexei and Waren. I decided to make this move for my boys so that they could have the opportunity to experience the American Dream. I have a Bachelors Degree in Early Childhood Education along with my Illinois Director Licenses. I had to switch to my current field because it was a struggle for me to get hired as a Program Director; all the Program Director jobs that I applied for I was racially profiled. The interviewers would always suggest that I should consider being a Teacher or Teacher's Assistant, although I am qualified with over 15 years’ experience working in a similar position. I hope that pursuing this Masters in Data Science that I will be given a chance to gain some experience and showcase my knowledge.
I’m interested in biking, road trips and traveling to different countries with my boys. 
I’m currently during a research on the Dream Project experimenting with ELAN, and working on completing my MSc in data science. I will be graduating Summer 2023.

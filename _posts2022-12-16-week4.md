** Findings on Data Used For Research**

The project was to study timing between words using ASL linguistics: mouthing/mouth morphemes. After
creating the dataset from ELAN for the statistics, there was insufficient data.

We decided on grouping the annotations for individual signs into categories. This annotation system consists of five classes, which are
Fingerspelling, Lexical Variations, Indices, Classifier Predicates and Gestures. We will then use these classes
to find commonalities between signers, by using the mean, median and standard deviation to test the significance of the spread within the classes, 
the latency/duration between signs and consistency between signers.
